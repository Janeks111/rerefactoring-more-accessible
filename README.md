# rerefactoring-more-accessible

## Description

Marketing agency reached out to me and asked me to update their website code.
They wanted the codebase to follow accessibility standards so that site is optimised for search engines.

While working on this feature request I did the following

-Added semantic structure to the code to improve the readability.

-Consolidated the CSS to make code by DRY standards.

-Organised the CSS in alphabetical way so that in the future it is easier to find the needed section.

-Added comments to both HTML and CSS for future developers easier readability.

-Added alternative text to all the images and icons to improve SEO for the website and make it more accessible.

-Changed pixel measurements to root-em to optimise the content to different screen sizes.
